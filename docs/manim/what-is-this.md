# What is Manim?
And what is it doing in the configuration folder?

Manim is the software I used to make the animations you see in the other documentation files. It is a tool developed by [Grant Sanderson](https://github.com/3b1b), also known as [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/), so all props go to him! Though, this version in particular, Manim Community Edition, is not mantained by him, he is the one that made the original tool.

Here, you can find the scripts used to generate the animations you see in the documentation.
