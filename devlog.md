This is, by far, the devlog with most hours registered this project has ever had. So, what new, cool thing did I implement? Nothing! This time was almost entirely dedicated writing _documentation_, and preparing the project to be released.

One of the main challenges I knew I'd have to face when starting this project was explaining it to other people. The math behind it is quite complex (get it?), so I knew that, eventually, I'd have to write some sort of educational guide to tell people what it does, and how to use it. More than nine hours later, we're done!

I figured most people learn better visualy, so I poured some of my time to learn how to use Manim, the animation software 3blue1brown uses for his videos. I made about a dozen animations with it, and wrote a guide to introduce a laymen into complex analysis and function plotting.
Additionally, I also documented how the tool works internally (basically doing the same thing that I already did with the devlogs, but to more depth), and its features. 
This, plus an install guide, getting a bunch of screenshots and videos from the plotter to put in README, makes us have completed our project's documentation!

A small portion of this time was also dedicated to making the project build to a single executable, for it to have a favicon, and other small quality-of-life changes. Next we'll bugfix, and this project will be ready to ship!

Attached, some of the animations!
